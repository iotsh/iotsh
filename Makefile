# The old school Makefile, following are required targets. The Makefile is written
# to allow building multiple binaries. You are free to add more targets or change
# existing implementations, as long as the semantics are preserved.

#   make              - default to 'build' target
#   make test         - run unit test
#   make build        - build local binary targets
#   make container    - build containers
#   make push         - push containers
#   make clean        - clean up targets
#
# The makefile is also responsible to populate project version information.

# Tweak the variables based on your project.
